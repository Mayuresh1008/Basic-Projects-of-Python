# Basic-Projects-of-Python
This repository contains a collection of basic Python projects that I have created as part of my learning journey in Python programming. These projects are designed to help me practice core concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, user input, and more. They serve as hands-on examples of Pythonâ€™s capabilities and can be easily modified or expanded as I continue to grow my skills.

Projects Included:
1. Band Name Generator : A fun project where the program generates a random band name based on user input.

2. Tip Calculator : A simple Python program that calculates the tip amount based on the total bill and the tip percentage entered by the user. It helps split the total cost among multiple people, making it perfect for dining out with friends!

3. Pizza Devilery : A Python program that simulates a pizza ordering system. Users can customize their order by selecting pizza size, toppings, and extras. The program calculates the total cost based on the choices made.
